# CRUD
This is a small project I took on, for the sake of learning and utilizing CRUD (using localStorage and sessionStorage) as a programming concept.
Although you may observe a lot of code had been written prior to the first commit, but that's because I didn't initially intend to bring this project to GitHub.
